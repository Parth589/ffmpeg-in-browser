# ffmpeg-in-browser

This is a static website which enables users to run ffmpeg commands from browser without installing into your machine. 

### Usage:
- load webassembly files ~32MB. this may take some time according to your network connection.
- upload video.
- enter ffmpeg command to execute. (put only argument list in the text box)
- execute. (you can see various logs in the browser console. (if you really want to stare it the whole time.)
- find and save your output files from the built in file browser.

### This whole thing runs on your browser locally. so you can spend data to watch *USEFUL STUFF* on internet.

### Credits:
The Web assembly and core script is taken from [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) package.
